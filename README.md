# Todo In Different Frameworks
Build todo list in different frameworks.\
Including:
- Vanilla (with javascript only) (ES6+)
- Vue.js

## Build
I use <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite">Vite</a> as the build tool in this project, which provides a incredibly fast development experience. Taking advantage of <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement">HMR</a>, it is possible to see the result after any changes within a second.

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
# Warning: build server provided by Vite is still in preview
```
